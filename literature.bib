Such needs require the code to be consistently reliable over the entire energy range (from MeV to TeV) for all projectiles (full suite of elementary particles and heavy ions). Outside CERN, among various applications worldwide, FLUKA serves as a core tool for the HIT and CNAO hadron-therapy facilities in Europe. Therefore, medical applications further impose stringent requirements in terms of reliability and predictive power, which demands constant refinement of sophisticated nuclear models and continuous code improvement. Some of the latest developments implemented in FLUKA are presented in this paper, with particular emphasis on issues and concerns pertaining to CERN and medical applications.},

  abstract  = {ABSTRACT We have upgraded many features of the Particle and Heavy Ion Transport code System (PHITS) and released the new version as PHITS3.02. The accuracy and the applicable energy ranges of the code were greatly improved and extended, respectively, owing to the revisions to the nuclear reaction models and the incorporation of new atomic interaction models. Both condense history and track-structure methods were implemented to handle the electron and positron transport, although the latter is reliable only for simulations in liquid water. In addition, several user-supportive functions were developed, such as new tallies to efficiently obtain statistically better results, radioisotope source-generation function, and software tools useful for applying PHITS to medical physics. Owing to the continuous improvement and promotion of the code, the number of registered users has exceeded 3,000, and it is being used in diverse areas of study, including accelerator design, radiation shielding and protection, medical physics, and cosmic-ray research. In this paper, we summarize the basic features of PHITS3.02, especially those of the physics models and the functions implemented after the release of PHITS2.52 in 2013.},

  abstract               = {Irradiators utilizing radioactive cesium-137 ((137)Cs) or cobalt-60 ((60)Co) gamma-ray sources have been used for biological applications for many decades. These applications include irradiation of much of the nation's blood supply and radiation biology research. In 2005, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission was assigned the task of preventing the misuse of radioactive materials by persons with malicious intentions; gamma-ray sources, in particular, were given high priority. This resulted in increased security requirements, including constant surveillance, controlled access and personnel background checks. As a result of such regulations being introduced, organizations considering the purchase of a gamma-ray irradiator for the first time or as a replacement to an existing one due to radioactive decay, are now looking into alternative technologies, primarily an X-ray irradiator. To make an educated decision on whether a particular type of X-ray irradiator is of sufficient equivalency to a particular type of (137)Cs irradiator for specific applications, one must rely on relevant published comparison studies from other researchers, or perform the comparison studies on their own. This work focuses on the comparison of the radiation physics aspects of two (137)Cs irradiator models and three X-ray irradiator models, for the purpose of determining whether the X-ray irradiator models could validly replace the (137)Cs irradiator models for certain applications. Although evaluating the influence of relative biological effectiveness (RBE) differences among irradiators could be part of this study, that has been left for a related publication focused on the theoretical aspects of this topic. These evaluations were performed utilizing 47-g and 120-g tissue-equivalent rodent dosimetry phantoms. Our results indicate that, depending upon the user's dose uncertainty budget and maximum areal density of specimens to be irradiated, the RS 2000 160 kVp X-ray irradiator, X-RAD160 X-ray irradiator or X-RAD320 X-ray irradiator could successfully replace a (137)Cs irradiator. Technically, any X-ray irradiator model providing similar irradiation geometry, and average energy similar to or higher than these three X-ray models, could also successfully replace a (137)Cs irradiator. The results also reveal that differences in inherent source geometry, field geometry and irradiation geometry can counter some of the influence due to differences in energy spectrum. Our goal is that this publication be used as a guide for other similar studies, providing investigators with information on important details that can make the difference between strong and weak comparison conclusions.},

  abstract  = {Purpose: A semiempirical model for x-ray production in tungsten thick-targets was evaluated using a new characterization of electron fluence. Methods: Electron fluence is modeled taking into account both the energy and angular distributions, each of them adjusted to Monte Carlo simulated data. Distances were scaled by the CSDA range to reduce the energy dependence. Bremsstrahlung production was found by integrating the cross section with the fluence in a 1D penetration model. Characteristic radiation was added using a semiempirical law whose validity was checked. The results were compared the experimental results of Bhat et al., with the SpekCalc numerical tool, and with mcnpx simulation results from the work of Hernandez and Boone. Results: The model described shows better agreement with the experimental results than the SpekCalc predictions in the sense of area between the spectra. A general improvement of the predictions of half-value layers is also found. The results are also in good agreement with the simulation results in the 50?640 keV energy range. Conclusions: A complete model for x-ray production in thick bremsstrahlung targets has been developed, improving the results of previous works and extending the energy range covered to the 50?640 keV interval.},

  abstract = {Beam hardening and scattering effects can seriously degrade image quality in polychromatic X-ray CT imaging. In recent years, polychromatic image reconstruction techniques and scatter estimation using Monte Carlo simulation have been developed to compensate for beam hardening and scattering CT artifacts, respectively. Both techniques require knowledge of the X-ray tube energy spectrum. In this work, Monte Carlo simulations were used to calculate the X-ray energy spectrum of FleXCT, a novel prototype industrial micro-CT scanner, enabling beam hardening and scatter reduction for CT experiments. Both source and detector were completely modeled by Monte Carlo simulation. In order to validate the energy spectra obtained via Monte Carlo simulation, they were compared with energy spectra obtained via a second method. Here, energy spectra were calculated from empirical measurements using a step wedge sample, in combination with the Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (MLEM) method. Good correlation was achieved between both approaches, confirming the correct modeling of the FleXCT system by Monte Carlo simulation. After validation of the modeled FleXCT system through comparing the X-ray spectra for different tube voltages inside the detector, we calculated the X-ray spectrum of the FleXCT X-ray tube, independent of the flat panel detector response, which is a prerequisite for beam hardening and scattering CT artifacts.},
